                <p>I was born January 1994 in Cleveland, Ohio. I attended Lutheran High School West where I ran cross country
                    and participated in building sets for the drama department. In 2016, I graduated from Butler University
                    with a bachelorâ€™s degree in actuarial science. Currently, I work part-time at Kohls as a freight associate.
                </p>
                <br/>
                <p>During my time at college, I learned that actuarial science was not something I was interested in pursuing.
                    Since then, I have continued my education, while simultaneously looking for full-time employment. Currently, I am working on developing my web development and programing knowledge in hopes to work in data analysis.</p>
                <br/>
                <p>In my free time, I enjoy jogging, watching movies and tv shows, and playing video games with my friends.</p>
